# QuickStart for Content and Experience Cloud
## CECS QUICK START KIT – AN OVERVIEW
**Oracle Autonomous Content and Experience Cloud** is a cloud-based content hub to drive omni-channel content management and accelerate experience delivery. The mentioned Autonomous Content & Experience Cloud Service (CECS) project contains the provisioning video and lab material to demonstrate the detailed steps for the CSMs, SCs and other relevant stakeholders to provision an Autonomous CECS environment and plan for consumption as per customer’s requirements. These assets are part of the APAC Cloud TEST Drive 3.0 workshop content. 

## OBJECTIVE OF THE CECS QUICK START KIT

With the mantra of Consumption being the new currency in Oracle, the key objective of the CECS Quick Start Kit is to enable our CSM community to engage with Universal Credit customers on an important area of content collaboration and web experience. The assets will help in the following:

**Self-service tools:** Help the CSM understand what tools are available around CECS adoption at a single place, and be empowered to drive consumption of the CECS.

**Proactively Identify Business Case for CECS:** Help the CSMs and other stakeholders like SCs to identify and showcase simple use cases of CECS like Building a Static Site to engage with business users. 

The above simple videos will give confidence to customers to understand the ease of the solution and share scenarios with CSMs and other Oracle experts to undertake quick adoption.

## OUTCOME OF THE CECS QUICK START KIT
With the CECS assets available at a single place and designed with the sole objective of driving consumption, the desired outcome of this exercise would be to have the Oracle UC customers have a provisioned instance of Autonomous CECS and successfully adopt some of the low hanging use cases of CECS like building a static microsite and building on a content hub.
